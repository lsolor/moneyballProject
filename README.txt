# moneyballProject
This is a machine learning project that is based off of the popular sports movement, Sabermetrics, which was brought to fame by the film Moneyball (2011). The goal of this project was to see if we could predict a player's WAR (wins above replacement) using their statline. We separated by pitchers and batters. With pitchers we were only concerned with their pitching ability. With batters we were only concerned with their offensive production. Using the sci-kit python module we pulled data from baseball reference and feed them into our preprocessing algorithm which created a dictionary where the key was a player's id and their statline as the value. We then had to transform our data structures into numpy arrays which is how sci-kit took its inputs. The data was then ran on multiple machine learning algorithms: bayesien learning, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks.
